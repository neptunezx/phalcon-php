# phalcon-php
Phalcon-PHP is a free replacement for the Phalcon Web Framework, delivered as a set of PHP classes based on the Phalcon Devtools. This project allows the usage of the Phalcon API in environments without the possibility to set up the phalcon extension (e.g. shared hosting) by providing a compatibility layer.
